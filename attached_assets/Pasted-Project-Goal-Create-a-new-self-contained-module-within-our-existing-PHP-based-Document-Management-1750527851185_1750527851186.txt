Project Goal:
Create a new, self-contained module within our existing PHP-based Document Management System (DMS). This module will be a premium, multi-tenant "SEO Project Timeline" dashboard. Crucially, this module must be a direct, interactive representation of the SEO Masterplan framework (see attached Overall Organization and Delivery.docx). It should use the same terminology (Pillars, Phases) and provide a seamless, intuitive user experience that feels worthy of a production environment.
1. UI/UX Philosophy & Design System
This is not a basic tool. The user experience is paramount.
Aesthetic: Clean, modern, spacious, and minimalist. Use a professional color palette (e.g., cool greys, deep blues for primary elements) with specific accent colors for status and pillars (e.g., Green for 'Completed', Red for 'Overdue', etc.).
Responsiveness: The entire interface must be fully responsive and function flawlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
Interactivity: Avoid disruptive full-page reloads. The application should feel fast and fluid, using AJAX for all data operations (creating, updating, deleting tasks). Use subtle loading spinners to indicate background activity.
Consistency: The UI components (buttons, modals, cards) should match the existing DMS's style guide. If one doesn't exist, establish a simple one based on a framework like Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind CSS, but with custom styling to make it look unique, not "cookie-cutter."
2. Database Schema (Revised for SEO Context)
Add the following tables. The new fields pillar, phase, and guideline_doc_link are essential for consistency with the Masterplan.
Table: dms_projects
id (INT, PK, AI)
project_name (VARCHAR)
owner_id (INT, FK to users.id)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)
Table: dms_project_members (The multi-tenant key)
id (INT, PK, AI)
project_id (INT, FK to dms_projects.id)
user_id (INT, FK to users.id)
permission_level (ENUM('edit', 'view'), DEFAULT 'view')
Table: dms_tasks (The core table, now with SEO context)
id (INT, PK, AI)
project_id (INT, FK to dms_projects.id)
task_name (VARCHAR)
assigned_to_id (INT, NULL, FK to users.id)
start_date (DATE, NULL)
end_date (DATE, NULL)
progress (INT, DEFAULT 0)
pillar (ENUM('Technical', 'On-Page & Content', 'Off-Page', 'Analytics'), NULL) - CRITICAL FIELD
phase (ENUM('1: Foundation', '2: Growth', '3: Authority'), NULL) - CRITICAL FIELD
guideline_doc_link (VARCHAR(255), NULL) - CRITICAL FIELD for linking to documents in the DMS.
status (VARCHAR, DEFAULT 'Not Started')
3. Backend Logic (PHP - Revised)
The API remains similar but must now handle the new SEO-specific fields.
api/timeline/tasks.php:
GET/POST/PUT requests must now process pillar, phase, and guideline_doc_link.
export_to_excel.php:
This is now more important. The exported .xlsx file must match the structure of your other Excel templates.
Use the PhpSpreadsheet library.
The columns must be: WBS, Phase, Pillar, Task Name, Assigned To, Start Date, End Date, Progress, Status. This ensures consistency for the end-user.
4. Frontend UI/UX (Revised and Detailed)
Page 1: timelines.php (Project Dashboard)
UI: Display projects as modern UI cards on a grid. Each card should feature:
The project_name in a bold, large font.
"Owner: [Owner's Name]".
A visual progress donut chart for that project's overall completion (calculated from task progress).
Avatar icons of the first 3-4 project members.
"View Timeline" and "Manage Members" buttons.
A "Create New Project" button with a smooth modal animation.
Page 2: project.php?id={id} (The SEO Project Timeline View)
This is the main screen. Implement a three-column professional layout:
Left Sidebar (Column 1 - Filters):
This is key for usability. Provide filter controls that update the Gantt chart in real-time.
Filter by Pillar (Checkboxes: Technical, On-Page, etc.).
Filter by Phase (Checkboxes: Foundation, Growth, etc.).
Filter by Assigned To (Dropdown of project members).
A "Clear Filters" button.
Main Content (Column 2 - The Timeline):
Use Frappe Gantt for a clean, modern look.
Customization: Configure the Gantt bars to be color-coded by their pillar. (e.g., Technical tasks are blue, Content tasks are green). This provides immediate visual context tied directly to your framework.
The left-hand task list next to the Gantt should be clean and readable.
Right Sidebar (Column 3 - Task Details):
Instead of a disruptive modal, when a user clicks a task, this sidebar slides into view.
It displays all details for the selected task.
All fields are editable directly in this sidebar (Task Name, Dates, Progress Slider, etc.).
Crucially, if the guideline_doc_link is present, display it as a prominent, clickable button: "View Guideline Document". This directly integrates the timeline with the rest of your DMS.
Include a "Save Changes" and "Delete Task" button at the bottom of the sidebar.
Multi-Tenant User Management (Manage Members Modal):
When a project owner clicks "Manage Members," open a clean modal.
It should list current members with a dropdown to change their permission ('edit'/'view') and a button to remove them.
An input field at the bottom allows the owner to "Invite a new member by email." The system should show an autocomplete list of existing users in the DMS as they type.
